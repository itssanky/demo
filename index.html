        <h1><b>Happy Birthday Pro Coder Sanjana Singh :)</b></h1>
        <p><div class="backimg">
            Many many happy returns of the day....And keep smilimg and shinning as you use to.......Happy Birthday.............<br>
            I know some short of misunderstanding has been created in between us or may some short distance has been generated due some misconversation<br>
            or some ego or attitude in both of us...... or May be some short of career competion made us like that...donot know whatever it is<br>
            I know most of the time may be you take me as your competetion even once you have said that also... but for me you are like a best friend or a sister<br>
            or a secret book of mine where every evil and pure secrects of mine has been buried.....Whatever I know you also love me little little...<br>
            But i donot because i think love is not the word that define our bond....It is all about 13 or 14 years of shaaring all our emotions<br>
            memories,the long phone calls,the long gossipes,the fights,the dance,the fun,the silly dirty talks....i think it has been long for long talks...<br>
            .......So that just a little cute feelings or a text .......Hope to see you at your proudest moment of life.....Making all of us proud...<br>
            Cherish your goals and keep going as you always.....And Janamdin ki bohot sari subhkamnaye :) ........<br><br>
           <h2> <b><strong>HAPPIEST  BIRTHDAY  TO YOU :)</strong></b></h2><br><br>And sorry if i misbehaved at some point of time....<br><br><br><br>
